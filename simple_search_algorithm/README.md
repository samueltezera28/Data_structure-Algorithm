## This is Simple Search Algorithm. written and compiled in dev C++.the program handles numerical value only so make sure to input number values only
these are the searching algorithm implemented in this program:
1)Binary Search: is on of efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items it works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list 
that could contain the iten until you have narrowed down the possible locations to just one

time complexity is O(log2(n))



2)Sequential search :sequential search is made over all items one by one. 
Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, 
otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

time compexity is O(n)
